# K-Means_Clustering
Implementation of generalizaed K-Means Clustering algorithm in C++.
The program works for all dimension points like 1D, 2D and and so on.
The 'input file' and value of 'k' must be given as command line arguments.
The final Cluster points are stored in a file called "cluster.txt".

Compilation and Execution Steps:
	1. In command prompt type: "g++ kmeans.cpp" and press enter.
	2. Then type: "a points.txt 2" and press enter.
			Here, 'a' is executable c++ code,
			      'points.txt' is input file and	
				    '2' is the number of clusters which may vary.





(NOTE:- The program is tested on Windows 8.1 with mingw C++ compiler.)
